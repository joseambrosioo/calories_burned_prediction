# Calories Burned Prediction Model

This project focuses on predicting calories burned during physical activities using advanced machine learning techniques. The model achieved outstanding performance, surpassing benchmark standards, with the following metrics:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 1.003  
- **R-Squared Score (RÂ²):** 0.999  
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** 2.035  
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** 1.426  

## Dataset and Features
- **Records:** 15,000 entries  
- **Features:** Activity duration, heart rate, body temperature  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  Uncovered patterns, trends, and outliers through:  
  - Visualizations  
  - Descriptive statistics  
  - Correlation analysis  

## Model Development
Implemented and evaluated multiple regression models to identify the optimal solution:
